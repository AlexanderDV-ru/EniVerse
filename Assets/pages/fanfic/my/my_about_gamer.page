	About  gamer_system in my world. Gamer feature is the variant of sixth shell
	difference is in that the gamer_system returns gamer into lobby if chance to extermination, don't try to save gamer here
	moving to lobby is may be because gamer_system is a shell created by strong god - god_of_games
	from it is following that gamer is immortal, but gamer_system saves body only with nozero hp
	after hp lost gamer_system saves only soul, and move it to lobby
		that means that last chance of gamer_system_t no_one_punch is minus, that saves your body, but gives big chance to destroy soul
